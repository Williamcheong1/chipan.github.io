								My name is William, and I graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York, where I majored in bakers, and my partner, Moses, graduated from the same school as me, and he majored in desserts. Since we are both alumni and classmates, we both had the idea of starting a business when we were in school. After graduation, we hit it off immediately, so we co-founded a cake company. With our exquisite cake making skills, we soon became a little famous and developed step by step to the present, a global chain of cake shops.                            </div>

I don't want to talk about vague theories and I don't have exorbitant expectations. Our values are in fact very simple: to do a good job every day in a serious and silent manner, to do our duty and to do every job in a sincere manner. If everyone in ordinary positions to achieve a good ordinary value, then, countless ordinary will be cast into great, countless ordinary will be cast into a very Life's ideals and values must be realized in the post, it is also necessary to master the knowledge and skills required to be competent in the work of the post.
